# Shared Costs App

https://shared-costs-app-7o3vcpzb5q-uc.a.run.app

An app for access to shared costs in your friends group. For every cost you can visualize the next information sorted by last payment made:

- Person who made the payment.
- Amount of payment.
- Description of the payment.
- Date of payment.

You also can do the following actions:

- Can add a person to your friends group.
- Add a payment.
- See a balance sheet to see how much money each person in the group has to pay or receive so that we would all have paid the same and not have debts among the group of friends.
