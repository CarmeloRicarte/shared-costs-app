# react-professional-configuration
### `FREE`
Welcome to the most professional React configuration template you can find!

This project is set up so that you only focus on the coding as I have done all the dirty work for you. You can play with the settings if you wish, but I recommend that you don't as it has very advanced and perfectly calculated settings.
